### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:denmark: My name is Kasper, I:

:point_right: love the dad-life :children_crossing:, as a PhD student :man_scientist:
 
:point_right: do [bioinformatics :dna:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics), professionally, mainly on [Linux :penguin:](https://pop.system76.com/) using [R](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [BASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) scripting
 
:point_right: build [R packages :package:](https://r-pkgs.org/), because I care about open and free software (and science)
 
:point_right: bundle up bioinformatic workflows, big or small, into portable :briefcase: [docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)/[singularity](https://sylabs.io/) containers, sometimes with a shiny [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) interface to run them
 - so anyone can
 - anywhere
 - on a tiny [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) or a huge HPC cluster

:point_right: build a [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) or two, tiny or huge
   - for monitoring the fermentation of your homebrewed beer :beer:
     - https://apps.cafekapper.dk/kaspbeerypi/
   - or analyzing :microscope: complex microbial communities :microbe:, simply:
